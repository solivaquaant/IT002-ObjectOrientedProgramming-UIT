He was born in a dark alley, one of the five kittens in his litter. 
His mother was a skinny tabby who had to scavenge for food every day. 
He never knew his father, who was probably a wandering tomcat. 
He learned to survive on the streets, dodging cars, dogs and humans. 
He had to fight for his territory and his meals. 
He got scars and wounds, but he also got stronger and smarter. 
He met other cats, some friendly, some hostile. 
He had a few mates, but none of them stayed with him for long. 
He fathered many kittens, but he never saw them grow up. 
He lived a hard and lonely life, but he also had moments of joy and freedom. 
He was a stray cat, and he was proud of it.
